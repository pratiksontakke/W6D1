## Agentic Frameworks Comparison

### Framework Analysis

**Code-Based:** LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, Haystack, OpenAI Assistants API
**No-Code:** Zapier Central, Flowise, LangFlow, Voiceflow, Botpress, n8n, Make

For each framework, analyze:

- Core capabilities and use cases
- Ease of use vs. customization flexibility
- Setup complexity and learning curve
- Performance and scalability
- Cost considerations
- Development Speed
- Scalability
- Cost Effectiveness

### Requirements

- Create a comparison table rating frameworks on:
- Build a simple agentic workflow example using one code-based and one no-code framework
- Document the development process and challenges

### Recommendations

Provide clear guidance on:

- When to choose code-based vs. no-code approaches
- Best framework for different use cases (chatbot, workflow automation, data analysis, etc.)

### Deliverables

**Document Requirements:**

- Include a comparison table, code examples, and screenshots
- Executive summary with key recommendations
- Submit as a shared Google Doc link

### Submission

Submit a shareable Google Doc link with view access enabled. ## Agentic Frameworks Comparison
